<h1>My first steps in natural language processing: converting a sentence to a conceptual graph</h1>
<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p>The article describes my small experiment: extracting information as a conceptual graph from a phrase in natural language.</p>
<p>This will allow me to manage the game character by voice or text messages.</p>
<p>The obtained results are a good basis for me for achieving some practical results in the future.
But they are not yet suitable for practical using right now.</p>
<h2>Background</h2>
<p>During the increased interest to AI in the society, I also wanted to try to do something in this direction.
Using it in games seemed as evident to me.
I have gotten an idea: to make a simple scene in Unity 3d by standard assets and try to write a simple AI for the scene.
The examples of game logic (which i saw) were pretty much spaghetti code in C#.
These rules in that code was a very simple and far from intelligence.</p>
<p>On the one hand, it is understandable: players want a lot of stupid &quot;meat&quot; for destroying it.
And in this case a game does not require an expensive and high-performance device.</p>
<p>At the same time, it disappointed me: where are the achievements in the area of AI.
In addition, in real games, the dullness of the characters is compensated by an excellent art.
I am only able to program.
And I do not have many opportunities for getting a such art.
I have an interest in voice control of the character.
Also it seemed to me as interesting to use documents in the natural language at economic and political simulators.</p>
<p>I quickly made a choice for a symbolic approach and for a system which is based on explicit rules.
It allows to clearly define a behavior of a character and to explain why this or that action was performed.</p>
<p>The feature that seemed me as very difficult and as very interesting: to convert a text in natural language to a machine-readable format.
It is still difficult for me, because. But now I have an expandable basis.</p>
<p>I was looking for a ready solution, because writing such solution is complex and also it takes a lot of time.
I did not find a solution which suited for me.
But controlling by natural language is a cool feature.
I also have bought a book which briefly describes main stages of natural language processing.
So I decided to try to convert at least one phrase by myself.
My way for it and the result are described here.</p>
<h2>Formulation of my task</h2>
<p>I want to convert the sentence &quot;I know the dog&quot; to a conceptual graph.
This task seems to me as small and it may be solved in a short time.
This is only one phrase which contains only four words.</p>
<h2>Making a phrase tree of target sentence</h2>
<p>Firstly, I must make a phrase tree of target sentence.
The sentence &quot;I know the dog&quot; should be transformed to a tree as in figure 1.</p>
